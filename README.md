This is a comparison of php8 and php7 for checking truthiness.

To install, do this:

```git clone https://github.com/JustinLawrenceMS/truthy_demo.git```

Fall into your truthy_demo directory and do this:

```docker compose build```

```docker compose up```

Access the container terminal with docker, and then cd into the truthy directory:

```cd truthy```

```php truth.php```

I don't see a difference.
